Plugins built specifically for PurpleJabber 

## How to pull the plugins via PurpleJabber
For this, I will be using the basic, native plugin `ViTest` as an example.

<sup>If you try to pullplugin the actual `ViTest` plugin, it will not work, as it will already be in your library</sup>
1. Run PurpleJabber
2. Copy the following, but change the argument/parameter
```
: /pullplugin vitest
```
3. Now, just install. Its as easy as that
```
: /plugin vitest
```
PurpleJabber will have downloaded the raw plugin from this repository in `plugins/` & equipped it to your belt.
